1.What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Ans: Pros:

2.Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Ans: Git allows to access multiple files stored in a repository where the user can view the previous and cuurent versions at once which allows the user to manipulate the differences in the versions.

3.How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Ans: git log command performs the operation to give the history of recent commits with its id and old and new data.
git diff command is used to compare the two commit id's and shows the old and new versions in that id.

4.Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Ans:We can store number of files with its modified and old versions .
